# Spot Edit

A simple, lean AI-powered document editing tool that identifies and updates key fields in documents through natural language chat.

## Overview

Spot Edit is a focused document editing assistant built around a straightforward workflow: drop in a document, tell the AI agent what needs to change in plain English, and let it intelligently identify and update all relevant fields. The approach is designed to be simple, repeatable, and effective.

## Core Concept

The project centers on three key principles:

1. **Simple & Lean**: Minimal interface, maximum utility. No bloat, just effective document editing.
2. **Smart Field Detection**: Upload any document (with automatic text conversion if needed), and the AI identifies key fields and areas that need updating.
3. **Natural Language Interaction**: Chat-based interface where you describe what you want changed, and the agent finds and updates all relevant fields automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Drop Document**: Upload your document into the chat window (supports various formats with automatic text conversion)
2. **Tell the Agent**: Describe your changes in natural language (e.g., "update all dates to 2024" or "change the company name to Acme Corp throughout")
3. **Agent Identifies**: The AI analyzes the document to find all relevant fields and areas that match your request
4. **Review & Apply**: See proposed changes and apply them with confidence

## Key Features

- **Document Upload & Conversion**: Accept various document formats, automatically convert to text for processing
- **Intelligent Field Detection**: Identify all instances of fields, values, and areas that need updating
- **Natural Language Commands**: No complex syntax—just tell the agent what you want in plain English
- **Multi-Field Updates**: Update multiple related fields across the document in one operation
- **Repeatable Process**: Consistent workflow that works the same way every time

## Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Every feature must earn its place. If it doesn't directly serve the core workflow, it doesn't belong.
- **Reliable & Repeatable**: The same input should produce predictable, consistent results.
- **Focused Scope**: Do one thing exceptionally well—AI-assisted document field updates.

## Use Cases

- Update dates, names, or values across legal documents
- Revise company information in templates and forms
- Modify technical specifications in documentation
- Change formatting or style consistently throughout documents
- Update references and citations
- Correct recurring errors or outdated information

## Technology Approach

The technical stack will be chosen to support the core goals of simplicity and repeatability:
- Lightweight document parsing and text extraction
- LLM integration for natural language understanding and field identification
- Simple UI for document upload and chat interaction
- Minimal dependencies, maximum reliability
